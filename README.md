# RockPaperScissors

This project is a Rock Paper scissors game that I built going Through the Odin Project. The project began with output going to the console and now has GUI that can be viewed at

I learned about transitions , manipulating content , and using branches in git. I learned about the difference between using javascript and CSS to create transitions and which to use in certain situations becuase of the inital transition I created when you load the page.  I also wanted to change the content without having to switch pages so I learned how to toggle the  content using events. The gui was created in another branch to separate that process from the initial project from earlier in the course and then merged which helped me better understand version control and its uses.
